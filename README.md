# Springboot_DEMO

## As as demo sample of Backend

### Tech I used here: Spring Boot, Mysql, mybatis, Redis

Basicly, use Spring boot as backend framework, store the content in Mysql.

To get better throughput, use Redis to cache the data.

To get easier operation, use mybatis as middleware to connect Java and Mysql.
